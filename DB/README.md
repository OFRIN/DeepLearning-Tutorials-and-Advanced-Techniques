# Datasets

- I think this repository is very important to experimentalize projects.
- The size of most vision datasets exceeds 100MB. So, I prepare two options. First, I will upload dataset in Google Drive. Second, if the size of dataset is lower than 100MB. I will upload dataset in this repository.

- All datasets I upload was opened by other researchers.

## 1. Classification Datasets
- I will add imbalance score.

| Name        | Classes       | Imbalance score | link |
| ------------- | -------------:| -----:| -----:|
| ImageNet| 1,000 | $1600 | link |
| MSCOCO | centered      |   $12 | link |
| OPIV6 | are neat      |    $1 | link |

## 2. Detection Datasets

## 3. Segmentation Datasets

## 4. Generation Datasets

## 5. Domain Adaptation Datasets

## 6. Anomaly Detection Datasets
